## The Italian Job Market

**by Federico Bozzini and Federico Semprini**

<small>*Data Visualization, academic year 2016/2017*<small>

---

### What

We will explore 3 aspects of the Italian job market:

1. How the gender balance evolved during the years
2. How the job market was influenced by the structural reforms, governments and other external factors
3. The number of hirings in the Italian regions during the years

---

### 1 - Gender Balance

We will explore how the number of males and females active in the job market evolved during the years from 1959 to 2015 using the ISTAT dataset. It will be possible to explore the data in both absolute and relative terms.

---

#### 1 - Implementation Idea

The visualization can be made with a stacked area chart and the interactivity can be managed with some combo box to select which data to show and whether to show absolute or relative data.

---

### 2 - External Factors

We will cross the occupational data (employment level, unemployment level from the ISTAT dataset) with external events like structural reform and government changes. There should be an evidence of if and how the events influenced the job market.

---

#### 2 - Implementation Idea

The visualization can be made with a line chart, where the visualization is divided in areas with different colors, each one representing the time frame between different events.

---

### 3 - Hirings, regional data

We will show how many hirings relative to the population there have been in every Italian region. We will use the dataset of the hirings per region (ISTAT dataset) and an external dataset for the population by region.

---

#### 3 - Implementation Idea

The visualization can be made with an area map, using a slider to select the year considered. An additional tree map may be added to visualize the absolute data.
