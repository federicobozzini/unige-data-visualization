## The Italian Job Market

**by Federico Bozzini and Federico Semprini**

<small>*Data Visualization, academic year 2016/2017*<small>

---

### The Applications

We will build 2 applications to explore different aspects of the Italian job market:

1. How the italian job market and its gender balance evolved during the years and how it was influenced by the structural reforms, governments and other external factors
2. How the number of new hirings and the voucher usage changes relatively to the Italian regions and how it evolved during the years

---

### 1 Gender Balance - WHAT

The main data source of our application will be the ISTAT dataset regarding the activity rate, employment rate and unemployment rate during the years ranging from 1959 to 2015. We will especially focus on the gender balance during the years and we will integrate the original data with the datasets of the external factors that may have influenced the job market (eg: government changes, structural reforms).

---

### 1 Gender Balance - WHY

The main goals of the visualization will be to let the users explore the trends during the years. They will be able to focus on some specific trend (eg: umemployment rate, activity rate). They will be also able to visualize the data both in absolute and relative  (between the 2 genders) terms and cross the data with the other datasets regarding the external factors.

---

### 1 Gender Balance - HOW

The visualization will be made with a stacked area chart and the interactivity will be managed with some combo boxes and radio buttons that will allow the users to select which trends to show, whether to show absolute or relative data and which external factor to consider.

### 2 Regional Data - WHAT

In this application we will focus on the Italian regional data compiled by ISTAT, from year 2013 to year 2015. Our main sources will be the datasets of the new hirings and of the voucher usage. We will also integrate these data with another dataset of the Italian regional population.

---

### 2 Regional Data - WHY

The main goal of this application will be to offer the users some insight on the regional data of the new hirings and the voucher usage. The users will be able to select which dataset to visualize and whether to visualize the absolute data or the data weighted by population.

---

#### 2 Regional Data - HOW

The visualization will be made using an area map and possibly a tree map or a bar chart. The interactivity will be managed with radio buttons, select boxes and combo boxes that will allow the users to select which dataset and year to visualize.
